# MyNN

This is my implementation of a neural network from scratch. Included is a simple feedforward neural network (see nn.py) and a convolutional neural network (see cnn.py). All files are implemented without using an DL libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, Numpy is used for the matrix opertaions.

This was a project from my Convolutional Neural Networks class. Some of the implmentation is crude due to time constraints, I would like to come back to it later and clean it up. I found writting sumle NN operations from scratch allowed me to better understand what is happening behind the scenes in a NN.
