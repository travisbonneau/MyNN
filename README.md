# MyNN

This is my implementation of a neural network from scratch. Included is a simple feedforward neural network (see [nn.py](/src/nn.py)) and a convolutional neural network (see [cnn.py](/src/cnn.py)). All files are implemented without using an DL libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, Numpy is used for the matrix opertaions.

This was a project from my Convolutional Neural Networks [class](https://github.com/arthurredfern/UT-Dallas-CS-6301-CNNs). Some of the implmentation is crude due to time constraints, I would like to come back to it later and clean it up. I found writting sumle NN operations from scratch allowed me to better understand what is happening behind the scenes in a NN.
